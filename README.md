# waveline-client-svelte
A Svelte based Waveline web client to be used in tandem with https://github.com/brocococonut/waveline-server-go

While it _should_ be compatible with the [standard waveline API](https://github.com/Wellenline/waveline-server) (unless its API has any major changes I haven't factored in), I've been developing it with the GoLang version as the API endpoint.

The code is very much under construction, but this is what I have so far. The TODO.md file has the current status of things.
